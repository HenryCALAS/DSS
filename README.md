# DASS HLS Compiler

DASS is a platform tool for generating high-level synthesis (HLS) hardware. A central task in HLS is scheduling: the allocation of operations to clock cycles. The classic approach to scheduling is static, in which each operation is mapped to a clock cycle at compile-time, but recent years have seen the emergence of dynamic scheduling, in which an operationâ€™s clock cycle is only determined at run-time. Both approaches have their merits: static scheduling can lead to simpler circuitry and more resource sharing, while dy- namic scheduling can lead to faster hardware when the computation has non-trivial control flow.
In this work, we seek a scheduling approach that combines the best of both worlds. Our idea is to identify the parts of the input program where dynamic scheduling does not bring any perfor- mance advantage and to use static scheduling on those parts. These statically-scheduled parts are then treated as black boxes when creating a dataflow circuit for the remainder of the program which can benefit from the flexibility of dynamic scheduling.
An empirical evaluation on a range of applications suggests that by using this approach, we can obtain 74% of the area savings that would be made by switching from dynamic to static scheduling, and 135% of the performance benefits that would be made by switching from static to dynamic scheduling.

## Building 

### Requirements

[Vivado HLS](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado/integration/esl-design.html)

[Dynamatic HLS tool](https://dynamatic.epfl.ch)

### Linking Vivado HLS

In the `env.tcl` file, you need to specify where your Vivado HLS is, like:
```
VHLS=/tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2019.2/bin/vivado_hls
```

### Building Dynamatic

The tool automatically installs Dynamatic by default. If you already have Dynamatic installed, you can simply comment the first two lines in `install.sh` and also change the directory in `env.tcl`, like:
```
DHLS=tools/dynamatic
```

### Build DASS:

To install DASS, you can simply run:
```
bash install.sh
```

## Test Examples

You can simply play with our examples in the `examples` folder:

```
cd examples
make name=gSum # Try gSum example
```

Then you should have the output hardware under the `gSum/vhdl/` folder.
